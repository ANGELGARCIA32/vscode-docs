# GitHub Copilot is now available for free in VS Code

GitHub Copilot is changing the way developers like you write code and build applications. We want everyone to experience the joy - that magical moment when AI writes the code that was on the tips of your fingers without you even having to ask.

So we're excited to announce a **free tier for GitHub Copilot**. All you need is a GitHub login. No trial. No gimmicks. No credit card required.

With the GitHub Copilot free tier, you get **access to both Claude and 4o models**.

You get **2000 code completions/month**. That's about 80 per day - which a lot.

You also get **50 chat requests/month** and a **64k context window** with **128k coming soon**.

If you hit these limits, ideally it's because Copilot is doing it's job well, which is to help you do yours! If you find you need more Copilot, the individual plan is unlimited, provides access to additional models like o1 and Gemini, and is still only **10$ per month**.

The VS Code and GitHub teams have been hard at work, as always, improving the GitHub Copilot experience for 37 million VS Code users just like you. Here's just a few examples that might make you say, "GitHub Copilot Can Do That?"

### GitHub Copilot Edits

GitHub Copilot Edits is an AI-powered code editing session where you can quickly iterate on code changes using natural language. Given a prompt, Edits will propose changes across files including creating new files when needed. This gives you the conversational flow of chat, along with the power of Copilot's code generation capabilities. The result is something you have to try to believe.

I was able to [build a clone of my favorite word game as a native Android app](https://youtu.be/Vj13SdN6OxU?si=sUvbBw0KSQ5q6iWh) on a Sunday afternoon. I never wrote a single line of code. The future is here, and it's amazing.

### Custom Instructions



### Full Project Awareness

GitHub Copilot has AI powered domain experts that you can mention with the `@` syntax. We call these, "participants". The `@workspace` participant is a domain expert in the area of your entire codebase.

We will also do intent detection for you and include the `@workspace` automatically if we see you asking a question that requires full project context.

This works thanks to Blackbird, GitHub's code search engine. It even works for files you haven't committed yet because we keep the index in sync. If your code isn't in GitHub, we don't upload it there. We do the index right on your local machine.

### Choose your Model

The model you use matters a lot, so we give you the ability to choose. Whether you're using Chat, Inline Chat or Copilot Edits, you get to decide who your pair programmer is.
