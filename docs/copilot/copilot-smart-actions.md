# Smart actions

For several common scenarios, you can use _smart actions_ to get help from Copilot without having to write a prompt. Examples of these smart actions are generating commit messages, generating documentation, explaining or fixing code, or performing a code review. These smart actions are available throughout the VS Code UI.

## Editor Code Actions

## Generate a commit message and PR information

## Generate a pull request title and description

## Generate documentation

## Generate tests

## Explain code

## Fix testing errors

## Fix terminal errors

## Review code
Code selection
PR



In the editor, you can access smart actions by selecting a block of code, right-clicking, and then choosing **Copilot**.

The most powerful smart action is the **Fix** action that helps you correct coding issues. Select the _sparkle_ icon in the editor, and then choose **Fix using Copilot**. There is a corresponding `/fix` slash command.

Similarly, there's a **Copilot** > **Generate Docs** smart action (`/doc` slash command) to generate documentation for your code.
