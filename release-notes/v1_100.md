### Text Encodings

We finalized the API for working with text encodings in VS Code.

Specifically, this new API allows you to:

* Get the current `encoding` of a `TextDocument`
* Open a `TextDocument` with a specific `encoding`
* Encode a `string` to a `Uint8Array` with a specific `encoding`
* Decode a `Uint8Array` to a `string` using a specific `encoding`

## Proposed APIs


## Engineering


## Notable fixes


## Thank you

Last but certainly not least, a big _**Thank You**_ to the contributors of VS Code.
