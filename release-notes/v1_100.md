## Chat




### Create and launch tasks with agent mode

In the last iteration, `setting(github.copilot.chat.newWorkspaceCreation.enabled) (Experimental)` was introduced to enable workspace creation with agent mode. Now, at the end of this flow, users are prompted to create and run a task to launch their app or project, streamlining out-of-the-box launch and enabling easy task reuse.

### Improvements to the Fetch (web page) tool

Last month, we introduced the `#fetch` tool which allows you to fetch the contents of a web page right from chat to include as context for your prompt. If you missed that release note, check out [the initial release of the fetch tool](v1_99.md#fetch-tool) release note which has examples.

This iteration, we have made several big changes to the tool including:
* **Entire page as context**: We now add the entire page as context, rather than a subset. With larger context windows, we have the ability to give the model the entire page so that it's possible to ask summarization questions, for example, that require as much of the page as possible. If you _do_ manage to fill up the context window, The tool is smart enough to exclude the less relevant sections of the page so that you don't go over the context window and the important parts are still kept.
* **A standardized page format (Markdown)**: Previously, we formatted fetched webpages in a custom heirarchical format that did the job, but due to its custom nature it was sometimes hard to reason with. We now convert fetched webpages into Markdown - a standarized language. This improves the reliability of the "relevency detection" and is a format most language models know deeply so they can reason with more easily.

We'd love to hear how you use the Fetch tool and if there are any capabilities you'd like to see from it!

### `#githubRepo` tool for searching code of a GitHub repository

The new `#githubRepo` tool quickly finds relevant code snippets from any GitHub repo that you have access too.

This tool takes a `USER/REPO` and is a great way to quickly ask about a project you don't currently have open in VS Code. You can also use [custom instructions](../docs/copilot/copilot-customization.md#custom-instructions) to hint to Copilot when and how to use this tool:

```md
---
applyTo: '**'
---
Use the `#githubRepo` tool with `microsoft/vscode` to find relevant code snippets in the VS Code codebase.
Use the `#githubRepo` tool with `microsoft/typescript` to answer questions about how TypeScript is implemented.
```

![Using the #githubRepo tool with hints from custom instructions](images/1_100/github-repo-tool-example.png)

Keep in mind that if you want to ask about the repo you are currently working on, you can just use the [`#codebase` tool](../docs/copilot/reference/workspace-context.md#making-copilot-chat-an-expert-in-your-workspace). Also this tool is only for searching for relevant code snippets. The [GitHub MCP server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server?tab=readme-ov-file#github-mcp-server) provides tools for working with GitHub issues and pull requests.

## Accessibility

### Merge editor improvements

The merge editor is now more accessible. To learn about available actions, open the accessibility help dialog within the merge editor (`kb(editor.action.accessibilityHelp)`). Key actions include `Merge Editor: Complete Merge` (`kb(mergeEditor.acceptMerge)`) and `Toggle Between Merge Editor Inputs` (`kb(mergeEditor.toggleBetweenInputs)`). The currently focused input is also now announced to assistive technologies.

### Next edit suggestion enhancements

The new setting `setting(accessibility.signals.nextEditSuggestion)` notifies users when a predicted suggestion is available. Review and accept suggestions through the accessible view (`kb(editor.action.accessibleView)`). Additionally, `setting(accessibility.signals.diffLineAdded)` and `setting(accessibility.signals.diffLineRemoved)` provide audio cues during navigation to make diff review accessible.

### Review Copilot user requests from the accessible view

When in agent mode, Copilot will sometimes require user permission to run actions. Review these actions within the accessible view (`kb(editor.action.accessibleView)`).

### Unique accessibility sounds

`setting(accessibility.signals.save.sound)` now has its own distinct sound and no longer shares audio with `setting(accessibility.signals.terminalCommandSucceeded.sound)`.

### Chat mode keybindings

The keyboard shortcut `kb(workbench.action.chat.open)` still just opens the chat panel, but the `kb(workbench.action.chat.openAgent)` shortcut will now open chat and switch to agent mode. If you'd like to set up keybindings for other chat modes, there is a command for each mode:

- `workbench.action.chat.openAgent`
- `workbench.action.chat.openEdit`
- `workbench.action.chat.openAsk`

### Agent informed of undos and manual edits

Previously, making manual edits during an agent mode session could confuse the model. Now, the agent is prompted about your changes, and should re-read files when necessary before editing files that may have changed.

### Conversation history summarized and optimized for prompt caching

We've made some changes to how our agent mode prompt is built to optimize for prompt caching. Prompt caching is a way to speed up model responses by maintaining a stable prefix for the prompt. The next request is able to resume from that prefix, and the result is that each request should be a bit faster. This is especially effective in a repetitive series of requests with large context, like you typically have in agent mode.

When your conversation gets long, or your context gets very large, you may see this message in your agent mode session:

![summarized conversation message](images/1_100/summarized-conversation.png)

Instead of keeping the whole conversation as a FIFO, breaking the cache, we compress the conversation so far into a summary of the most important information and the current state of your task. This keeps the prompt prefix stable, and your responses fast.

If you prefer, you can disable this with `setting(github.copilot.chat.advanced.summarizeAgentConversationHistory)`.

## Workbench

### Floating windows compact and always-on-top mode

Floating windows in VS Code allow you to move editors and certain views out of the main window into a smaller window for lightweight multi-window setups. There are 2 new modes a floating window can have:
* compact: we hide certain UI elements to make more room for the actual content
* always-on-top: the window will stay on top of all other windows until you leave this mode

Here is an example of how to turn a floating editor window into compact mode:

<video src="images/1_100/floating-compact.mp4" title="Video that shows floating window compact mode." autoplay loop controls muted></video>

We leverage compact mode by default for when you create a Chat in a new window. Combined with the option to have the window always on top, you can always keep the Chat window around for asking questions!

<video src="images/1_100/floating-pinned.mp4" title="Video that shows floating window always on top." autoplay loop controls muted></video>

New commands are introduced if you prefer to use keyboard shortcuts:
* `workbench.action.toggleWindowAlwaysOnTop`: to toggle always on top mode
* `workbench.action.enableWindowAlwaysOnTop`: to set the floating window always on top
* `workbench.action.disableWindowAlwaysOnTop`: to set the floating window normal
* `workbench.action.toggleCompactAuxiliaryWindow`: to toggle compact mode
* `workbench.action.enableCompactAuxiliaryWindow`: to enable compact mode
* `workbench.action.disableCompactAuxiliaryWindow`: to disable compact mode

*Note:* even in compact mode you can create complex editor layouts and open other editors.

### New setting to control secondary sidebar default visibility

A new setting `setting(workbench.secondarySideBar.defaultVisibility)` allows to control if the secondary sidebar should open automatically in new workspaces or windows. You can pick from:
* `hidden`: this is the default and keeps the secondary sidebar hidden
* `visibleInWorkspace`: this will open the secondary sidebar if you open a folder or multi-root workspace
* `visible`: this will always open the secondary sidebar

Note that once a workspace or window has been opened, the visiblity becomes a workspace state: if you close the secondary sidebar, it will remain closed in that workspace or window.


## Code Editing


## Chat


## Notebooks

### Find and Replace History Persistence

The Notebook Find Widget now supports persistent history for both the find and replace input fields. This will persist across reloads, and is controlled by the settings `setting(editor.find.history)` and `setting(editor.find.replaceHistory)`.

### Cell Output Drag and Drop for Chat

To enhance existing support for cell output usage within Copilot Chat, outputs are now able to be dragged into the chat panel for a seamless attachment experience. Currently, only image and textual outputs are supported. Outputs with an image mime type will be directly draggable, however to avoid clashing with text selection, textual outputs will require holding the `alt` modifier key to enable dragging. Improved UX will be explored for this in the coming releases.

<video src="images/1_100/output-dnd.mp4" title="Video that shows multiple cell outputs being attached as chat context via drag and drop." autoplay loop controls muted></video>

### Run Cell Tool for Copilot Agent

Copilot now has an LLM tool to run notebook cells which will allow the agent to perform updates based on cell run results or perform it's own data exploration as it builds out a notebook.

<video src="images/1_100/agent-notebook-run-edit-loop.mp4" title="Video that shows copilot running notebook cells, making updates based on an error, and retrying those cells." autoplay loop controls muted></video>

## Testing


## Languages

### Expandable Hovers for JavaScript and TypeScript (preview)

We've continued to iterate on the expandable hover feature for JavaScript and TypeScript. This feature lets you use a `+` and `-` in the hover widget to show more or less type information information.

<video src="images/1_100/expandable-hover.mp4" title="TypeScript Expandable Hover" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

This feature is still experimental but you can try it today by enabling `setting(typescript.experimental.expandableHover)`. You must be using TypeScript version 5.9 or above, for example by installing the [TypeScript nightly extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next).

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

- TODO @ntrogh: add remote highlights here

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_98.md).


## Contributions to extensions

### Python

#### Branch Coverage Support
Branch coverage is now supported in the Testing Explorer for Python! Note your `coveragepy` version must be >= 7.7 for this feature. You can upgrade coverage by running `pip install coverage==7.7`.

![Gif showing coverage run using the test explorer and branch coverage displayed.](/release-notes/images/1_100/branch-coverage-py.gif)

#### Python Environments Quick Create command

The [Python Environments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-python-envs) extension has added support for Quick Create, making the environment creation process more seamless. Quick Create minimizes the input needed from you to create new virtual environments by detecting the latest Python version on your machine to create the virtual environment and install any workspace dependencies with a single click. This will create a `.venv` in your workspace for venv based environments, and `.conda`  conda for conda based environments. You can access Quick Create via the `Python: Create Environment` command in the Command Palette.

![Image showing Quick Create in the Python: Create Environment quick pick.](/release-notes/images/1_100/python-envs-quick-create.png)

#### Python Environments Tools for Copilot
The [Python Environments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-python-envs) extension (preview) now includes two Copilot tools: “Get Python Environment Information” and “Install Python Package”. To use, you can either directly reference the tools in your prompt by adding `#pythonGetEnvironmentInfo` `#pythonInstallPackage` or agent will automatically call the tool as applicable. These tools seamlessly detect appropriate environment information based on file or workspace context, and handle package installation with accurate environment resolution.

![Gif demoing the get environment information tool call implicitly by the model in copilot agent mode.](/release-notes/images/1_100/py-get-env-tool.gif)

![Gif demoing the get install package tool call for numpy version 2.2.](/release-notes/images/1_100/py-install-pkg-tool.gif)


#### Color picker when using Pylance

Pylance can now display an interactive color swatch directly in the editor for recognized color values in Python files, making it easier to visualize and pick colors on the fly. To try it out, you can enable `setting(python.analysis.enableColorPicker:true)`. Supported formats include #RGB (like "#001122") and #RGBA (like "#001122FF").

![Color swatch displayed in the editor next to #RGB color format.](images/1_100/pylance-color-picker.png)

#### AI Code Actions: Convert Format String

When using Pylance, there's a new experimental AI Code Action for converting string concatenations to f-string or format(). To try it out, select the **Convert to f-string with Copilot** or the **Convert to format() call with Copilot** Code Actions through the light bulb when selecting a symbol in the string you wish to convert, or through `kbstyle(Ctrl+.)`/`kbstyle(Cmd+.)`.

![Convert strings Code Actions, powered by Copilot](images/1_100/pylance-convert-string.png)

This experience is enabled via the following setting:
```
"python.analysis.aiCodeActions": {"convertFormatString": true}
```

Then once you define a new symbol, for example, a class or a function, you can select the **Generate Symbol with Copilot** Code Action and let Copilot handle the implementation! If you want, you can then leverage Pylance's **Move Symbol** Code Actions to move it to a different file.

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues


## Extension Authoring

### Text Encodings

We finalized the API for working with text encodings in VS Code.

Specifically, this new API allows you to:

* Get the current `encoding` of a `TextDocument`
* Open a `TextDocument` with a specific `encoding`
* Encode a `string` to a `Uint8Array` with a specific `encoding`
* Decode a `Uint8Array` to a `string` using a specific `encoding`

## Proposed APIs
