## Chat

### Chat Tool Set

VS Code now allows to define tool sets, this can be done through a proposed API and by users themselves. Tool sets are a collection of different tools that can be used just like tools. For instance, the tool set below is for managing GitHub notifications (using the [GitHub MCP server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server))

```json
{
  "gh-news": {
    "tools": [
      "list_notifications",
      "dismiss_notification",
      "get_notification_details",
    ],
    "description": "Manage GH notification",
    "icon": "github-project"
  }
}
```

You can create such tool set via "F1 > Configure Tool Sets" and then include them in agent requests.

### Chat Editing

When editing files Copilot can take two different approaches: it either rewrites the file top to bottom or it makes multiple, smaller edits. Both approaches differ, e.g the former can be slower for large files and intermediate states do often not compile successfully. Because of that the UI adopts and conditionally disables auto-save and squiggles but only when needed.

We have also aligned the keybindings for the "Keep" and "Undo" commands. Keeping and undoing individual changes is now done with `kb(chatEditor.action.acceptHunk)` and `kb(chatEditor.action.undoHunk)`. In the same spirit we have also aligned the keybinding for keeping and undoing all changes in a file, they are now `kb(chatEditor.action.accept)` and `kb(chatEditor.action.reject)`. This is not just for aligment but also removes prior conflicts with popular editing commands (like "Delete All Left")

### Fix task configuration errors

Configuring tasks and problem matchers can be tricky. Use the `Fix with Github Copilot` action offered when there are errors in your task configuration to address them quickly and efficiently.

### Task diagnostic awareness

When the chat agent runs a task, it is now aware of any errors or warnings identified by problem matchers. This diagnostic context allows the agent to respond more intelligently to issues as they arise.

### Terminal cwd context

When a Copilot terminal is open and shell integration is active, the chat agent is aware of the current working directory (cwd), enabling more accurate and context-aware command support.

## Accessibility

### User action required sound

We’ve added an accessibility signal to indicate when chat requires user action. This is opt-in as we fine tune the sound. You can configure this behavior with `setting(accessibility.signals.chatUserActionRequired)`.

### New code action sounds

We’ve introduced distinct sounds for when a code action is triggered (`setting(accessibility.signals.codeActionTriggered)`) and when it is applied (`setting(accessibility.signals.codeActionApplied)`).

### Agent mode accessibility improvements

We now include rich information about confirmation dialogs in the accessible view - covering past tool runs, the current tool run, and any pending confirmations. This includes the inputs that will be used.

When a confirmation dialog appears in a response, the action’s title is now included in the ARIA label of the corresponding code block, the response’s ARIA label, and the live alert to provide better context for screen reader users.

## Editor Experience

### Keyword suggestions (Preview)

**Setting**: `setting(search.searchView.keywordSuggestions)`

Last milestone, we introduced [keyword suggestions](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_100#_semantic-text-search-with-keyword-suggestions-experimental) in the Search view to help you find relevant results faster. We have now significantly improved the performance of the suggestions, so you will see the results ~5x faster than before.

We have also moved the setting from the Chat extension into VS Code core, and renamed it from `github.copilot.chat.search.keywordSuggestions` to `setting(search.searchView.keywordSuggestions)`.

### Semantic search behavior options (Preview)

**Setting**: `setting(search.searchView.semanticSearchBehavior)`

With semantic search in the Search view, you can get results based on the meaning of your query rather than just matching text. This is particularly useful if you don't know the exact terms to search for.

By default, semantic search is only run when you explicitly request it. We have now added a setting to control when you want semantic search to be triggered:

* `manual` (default): only run semantic search when triggered manually via the button or keyboard shortcut `kb(search.action.searchWithAI)`
* `runOnEmpty`: run semantic search automatically when the text search returns no results
* `auto`: automatically run semantic search in parallel with text search for every search query

### Find as you type

**Setting**: `setting(editor.find.findOnType:true)`

Find-as-you-type has been the default behavior of the Find control, but now you can control whether to keep it that way or disable it so that it will only perform the search after hitting enter.

## Notebooks

### Notebook tools for agent mode

#### Configure Notebook

The [Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) contributes tools for configuring the Kernel of a Jupyter Notebook. This tool will ensure a Kernel is selected and is ready for use in the Notebook.
This involes walking the user through the process of creating a Virtual Environment if required (the recommeded approach) or prompting the user to select an exsting Python environment.

This tool ensures LLM can perform operations on the Notebook such as running cells with minimal user interaction, there by improving the overall user experience in agent mode.

## Source Control

## Tasks

### Instance policy

Task `runOptions` now has an `instancePolicy` property, which determines what happens when a task has reached its `instanceLimit`.

Options include `prompt` (default), `silent`, `terminateNewest`, `terminateOldest`, and `warn`.

## Contributions to extensions

### Python

#### Python chat tools

The [Python Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) extension now includes chat tools: “Get information for a Python Environment”, “Get executable information for a Python Environment”, “Install Python Package” and “Configure Python Environment”. You can either directly reference them in your prompt by adding `#getPythonEnvironmentInfo` `#installPythonPackage`, or agent mode will automatically call the tool as applicable. These tools seamlessly detect appropriate environment information based on file or workspace context, and handle package installation with accurate environment resolution.

The “Configure Python Environment” will ensure that the Python Environment is set up correctly for the workspace. This includes creating a Virtual Environment if needed and selecting that as the active Python Environment for the workspace.

Tools previously introduced in the [Python Environments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-python-envs) extension (preview) have been migrated to the Python extension, there by making these tools available to all users with the Python extension installed.

## Extension Authoring

### Web Environment detection
⚠️ Breaking change ⚠️

**Setting**: `setting(extensions.supportNodeGlobalNavigator)`

The Node.js extension host is now updated to v22 from v20, as part of our [Electron 35 runtime update](#electron-35-update). This update brings in support for the [`navigator` global object](https://github.com/nodejs/node/commit/b40f0c30743aaecd57071f7be305df43e1083817) in the desktop and remote extension hosts.

This change could introduce a breaking change for extensions that rely on the presence of the `navigator` object to detect the web environment.

To help extension authors migrate, we have created a polyfill for `globalThis.navigator` that is initialized to `undefined`, so your extension continues to work correctly. The polyfill is behind the `setting(extensions.supportNodeGlobalNavigator)` VS Code setting. By default, this setting is disabled and the polyfill is in place. We capture telemetry and log an error (in extension development mode) when your extension tries to access the `navigator` in this way.

In the future, this setting might be enabled by default, so we urge extension authors to migrate their code to be compatible with the new `navigator` global object. Follow these steps to migrate your code:

* Check the extension host log for a `PendingMigrationError` that has error stack originating your extension.
* Ensure checks like `typeof navigator === 'object'` are migrated to `typeof process === 'object' && process.versions.node` as needed.
* Enable `setting(extensions.supportNodeGlobalNavigator)`.
* Verify extension behavior remains unchanged.

## Engineering

### Electron 35 update

In this milestone, we are promoting the Electron 35 update to users on our stable release. This update comes with Chromium 134.0.6998.205 and Node.js 22.15.1. We want to thank everyone who self-hosted on Insiders builds and provided early feedback.

## Thank you

Last but certainly not least, a big _**Thank You**_ to the contributors of VS Code.
