Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the May 1.101 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the May milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A%22May+2025%22)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Chat
### User action required sound

We’ve added an accessibility signal to indicate when chat requires user action. This is opt-in as we fine tune the sound. You can configure this behavior with `setting(accessibility.signals.chatUserActionRequired)`.

### Task diagnostic awareness

When the chat agent runs a task, it is now aware of any errors or warnings identified by problem matchers. This diagnostic context allows the agent to respond more intelligently to issues as they arise.

### Terminal cwd context

When a Copilot terminal is open and shell integration is active, the chat agent is aware of the current working directory (cwd), enabling more accurate and context-aware command support.

### Keyword suggestions in core (Preview)

**Setting**: `setting(search.searchView.keywordSuggestions)`

We have migrated the setting previously in the chat extension as `github.copilot.chat.search.keywordSuggestions` to VS Code core as `search.searchView.keywordSuggestions`.
We have also significantly improved the performance of the suggestions, so you will be able to see the results ~5x faster than before.

### Semantic search behavior options (Preview)

**Setting**: `setting(search.searchView.semanticSearchBehavior)`

By default, Semantic Search is only run when you explicitly request it, but no we have added a setting for you to control the behavior you wish to have.

- manual: this is the default and will only request semantic search when you request it manually through the button or keybiding `(Cmd + I)`
- runOnEmpty: this will make semantic search to execute whenever you do a search and did not find any text results
- auto: this will run semantic search alongside text search every time you do a search in the search view

## Accessibility

### New code action sounds

We’ve introduced distinct sounds for when a code action is triggered (`setting(accessibility.signals.codeActionTriggered)`) and when it is applied (`setting(accessibility.signals.codeActionApplied)`).

### Agent mode improvements

We now include rich information about confirmation dialogs in the accessible view - covering past tool runs, the current tool run, and any pending confirmations. This includes the inputs that will be used.

When a confirmation dialog appears in a response, the action’s title is now included in the ARIA label of the corresponding code block, the response’s ARIA label, and the live alert to provide better context for screen reader users.

## Editor Experience

### Find as you type setting

**Setting**: `setting(editor.find.findOnType:true)`

Find as you type has been the default behavior of the find widget, but now you can control whether to keep it that way or disable it so that it will only perform the search after hitting enter.

## Code Editing

## Notebooks

## Source Control

## Terminal

### Gracefully shutdown terminal and task processes

We’ve added an opt-in setting, `setting(terminal.integrated.killGracefully)`, to cleanly shut down terminal processes, including child processes. This helps avoid orphaned processes, frees up ports, and can reduce the risk of resource leaks.

## Tasks

### Instance Policy

Task `runOptions` now has an `instancePolicy` property, which determines what happens when a task has reached its `instanceLimit`.

Options include `prompt` (default), `silent`, `terminateNewest`, `terminateOldest`, and `warn`.

![instancePolicy is being configured in a tasks.json file and displays the options with prompt as the default value](images/1_101/instancePolicy.png)
