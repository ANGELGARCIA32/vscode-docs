## Chat


### Terminal auto-approval (Experimental)

### Terminal command simplification

Agent mode sometimes wants runs commands with a `cd` statement just in case. We will now detect this case when it matches the current working directory and simplify the command that is run.

![Asking to run `cd C:\Github\Tyriar\xterm.js && echo hello` only runs `echo hello` when the current working directory already matches](images/1_102/image.png)

### Agent awareness of tasks and terminals

The Copilot agent now understands which background terminals it has created and which tasks are actively running. The agent can read task output using the new `GetTaskOutput` tool. This helps prevent running duplicate tasks and improves workspace context.

## Accessibility

### Keep all edits from within the editor

Formerly, to accept all edits, focus would need to be in the panel chat. Now, with focus in the editor, you can run the command **Keep All Edits** `kb(chatEditor.action.acceptAllEdits)`.

### User action required sound

Weâ€™ve fine-tuned the accessibility signal to indicate when chat requires user action and set the default value to `auto`, so screen reader users will hear this. You can configure this behavior with `setting(accessibility.signals.chatUserActionRequired)`.

### Alert when rendering errors occur in chat

Previously, screen reader users were not alerted when a chat rendering error would occur. Users are now alerted with this information and can also focus it via keyboard.

## Editor Experience

### Scroll on middle click

**Setting**: `setting(editor.scrollOnMiddleClick:true)`

Scroll the editor by simply clicking, or holding down your middle mouse button (the scroll wheel) and moving around.

Once activated, the cursor changes to a panning icon and moving the mouse up or down then smoothly scrolls the editor in that direction. The scrolling speed is determined by how far you move the mouse from the initial click point. Release the middle mouse button or click it again to stop scrolling and return to the standard cursor.

![Screenshot of the editor scrolling when the middle mouse button is clicked.](images/1_102/middle-scroll.png)

**Known Conflicts**

Enabling this feature interferes with other actions tied to the middle mouse button. For example, if you have column selection (`setting(editor.columnSelection)`) enabled, holding down the middle mouse button selects text. Similarly, on Linux, selection clipboard (`setting(editor.selectionClipboard)`) pastes content from your clipboard when the middle mouse button is clicked.

To avoid these conflicts, please enable only one of these settings at a time.

### Settings search suggestions (Preview)

**Setting**: `setting(workbench.settings.showAISearchToggle:true)`

This milestone, we modified the sparkle toggle in the Settings editor so that it acts as a toggle between the AI and non-AI search results. The AI settings search results are semantically similar results instead of results that are based on string matching. For example, `editor.fontSize` appears as an AI settings search result when you search for "increase text size".

The toggle is enabled only when there are AI results available. We welcome feedback on when the AI settings search did not find an expected setting, and we plan to enable the setting by default over the next iteration.

### Terminal Suggest (Preview) improvements

#### Selection Mode

A new setting, `terminal.integrated.suggest.selectionMode`, helps you understand that by default, `kbStyle(Tab)` (not `kbStyle(Enter)`) accepts suggestions. You can choose between `partial`, `always`, and `never` modes to control how suggestions are selected and accepted.

`partial` is the default value, which means that `kbStyle(Tab)` will accept the suggestion until navigation has occurred.

![The first terminal suggestion can be accepted with Tab](images/1_102/terminal-selection-mode.png)

#### Learn Nore

The **Learn More** action `(kb(workbench.action.terminal.suggestLearnMore))` in the terminal suggest widget status bar is now highlighted for the first 10 times or if the widget is shown for 10 seconds. This helps you discover how to configure, disable, and read about the suggest widget.

![The Learn More action appears in the terminal suggest widget status bar](images/1_102/terminal-suggest-discoverability.png)

#### Multi-command support

Terminal suggest now supports multi-command lines. You can link commands with `;`, `&&`, and other shell operators, and receive suggestions for all commands on the line.

![VS Code terminal showing a multi-command line with git commit and git push, and the terminal suggest widget displaying suggestions for pull, push, and other git commands.](images/1_102/terminal-suggest-multi.png)

#### Symlink information

We now display a symlink's realpath in the suggest details widget and have unique icons for symlink files and folders to help distinguish them from other suggestions.

![Terminal suggest shows the symlink's path -> real path](images/1_102/terminal-symlink.png)

#### Improved sorting

We've improved sorting in many ways - for example, giving `main` and `master` priority over other branches.

![Terminal suggest boosts main and master compared to other branch suggestions that start with ma](images/1_102/terminal-suggest-sorting.png)

#### Git bash improvements

We now properly support Git Bash path completions for folders and files. Additionally, we source the builtin commands and present them as suggestions.

![In a Git Bash terminal, suggestions show builtin functions like cat, cp, and curl](images/1_102/terminal-git-bash.png)
