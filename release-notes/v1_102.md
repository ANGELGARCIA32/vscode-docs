## Chat



### Agent awareness of tasks and terminals

The Copilot agent now understands which background terminals it has created and which tasks are actively running. The agent can read task output using the new `GetTaskOutput` tool. This helps prevent running duplicate tasks and improves workspace context.

## Accessibility

### Keep all edits from within the editor

Formerly, to accept all edits, focus would need to be in the panel chat. Now, with focus in the editor, you can run the command **Keep All Edits** `kb(chatEditor.action.acceptAllEdits)`.

### User action required sound

Weâ€™ve fine-tuned the accessibility signal to indicate when chat requires user action and set the default value to `auto`, so screen reader users will hear this. You can configure this behavior with `setting(accessibility.signals.chatUserActionRequired)`.

## Editor Experience

### Scroll on middle click

**Setting**: `setting(editor.scrollOnMiddleClick:true)`

Scroll the editor by simply clicking, or holding down your middle mouse button (the scroll wheel) and moving around.

Once activated, the cursor changes to a panning icon and moving the mouse up or down then smoothly scrolls the editor in that direction. The scrolling speed is determined by how far you move the mouse from the initial click point. Release the middle mouse button or click it again to stop scrolling and return to the standard cursor.

**Known Conflicts**

Enabling this feature interferes with other actions tied to the middle mouse button. For example, if you have column selection (`setting(editor.columnSelection)`) enabled, holding down the middle mouse button selects text. Similarly, on Linux, selection clipboard (`setting(editor.selectionClipboard)`) pastes content from your clipboard when the middle mouse button is clicked.

To avoid these conflicts, please enable only one of these settings at a time.

### Settings search suggestions (Preview)

**Setting**: `setting(workbench.settings.showAISearchToggle:true)`

This milestone, we modified the sparkle toggle in the Settings editor so that it acts as a toggle between the AI and non-AI search results. The AI settings search results are semantically similar results instead of results that are based on string matching. For example, `editor.fontSize` appears as an AI settings search result when you search for "increase text size".

The toggle is enabled only when there are AI results available. We welcome feedback on when the AI settings search did not find an expected setting, and we plan to enable the setting by default over the next iteration.

### Terminal Suggest (Preview) improvements

#### Terminal suggest selection mode

A new setting, `terminal.integrated.suggest.selectionMode`, helps you understand that by default, Tab (not Enter) accepts suggestions. You can choose between `partial`, `always`, and `never` modes to control how suggestions are selected and accepted.

#### Terminal suggest discoverability

The **Learn More** action `(kb(workbench.action.terminal.suggestLearnMore))` in the terminal suggest widget status bar is now highlighted for the first 10 times or if the widget is shown for 10 seconds. This helps you discover how to configure, disable, and read about the suggest widget.

#### Multi-command support for terminal suggest

Terminal suggest now supports multi-command lines. You can link commands with `;`, `&&`, and other shell operators, and receive suggestions for all commands on the line.
