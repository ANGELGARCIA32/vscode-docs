### Copilot Edits

#### Refined Editor Integration

We have polished the integation of Copilot Edits with code and notebook-editors.

* For once, we don't scroll along anymore as changes are being made. The view port stays put making it easier to focus on what changes.
* When we have renamed "Accept" to "Keep" and "Discard" to "Undo". This reflects better what's happening because changes for Copilot Edits are live, they are applied and saved as they are made and users keep keep or undo them
* Last, when having made the decision to keep or undo for a file the next file is automatically revealed.


The recording below shows how edits are applied and saved as they are made. The live preview updates and the user decided to "Keep" the changes. Undoing and further tweaking is also possible.

## Accessibility

### Copilot Edits

We made Copilot Edits much more accessible. There are now audio signals for files with modifications and for changed regions (insertions, modification, and deletion). The accessible diff viewer is now available for modified files. Just as in diff editors select `kb(chatEditor.action.showAccessibleDiffView)` to enable it.

### `activeEditorState` window title variable

We have a new `setting(window.title)` variable, `activeEditorState`, to indicate editor information such as modified state, the number of problems, and when a file has pending Copilot Edits to screen reader users. When in Screen Reader Optimized mode, this is appended by default and can be disabled with `setting(accessibility.windowTitleOptimized:false)`.

## Workbench

### Custom title bar on Linux

The custom title bar is now enabled by default on Linux:

![Screenshot that shows the custom VS Code title bar on Linux.](images/1_97/custom-title.png)

You can always revert back to the native title decorations, either from the custom title context menu or by configuring `setting(window.titleBarStyle)` to `native`.

![Screenshot that shows the content menu option to disable the custom title bar on Linux.](images/1_97/restore-title.png)

We are happy for continued feedback on this experience and are already working on improving this for future milestones based on existing feedback.

### Secondary Sidebar Shows Labels

We decided to change the appearance of views in the secondary sidebar to show labels instead of icons, similar to the panel. This helps discover the "Copilot Edits" view. You can always go back to showing icons by configuring `setting(workbench.secondarySideBar.showLabels)`.

![Screenshot that shows secondary sidebar with labels instead of icons.](images/1_98/aux-sidebar.png)

### New Settings editor key-matching algorithm

We have added a new Settings editor search algorithm that prioritizes more relevant key matches. Try it out by clicking `setting(workbench.settings.useWeightedKeySearch:true)`.

_Theme: [Light Pink](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgwg.light-pink-theme) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/editor/theme/mgwg.light-pink-theme))_

## Editor

### Peek References Support Drag & Drop

The peek view now supports drag & drop. Invoke Peek References, Peek Implementation and any of the other peek command and drag entries from its tree to open them as separate editors.

_Theme: [GitHub Light Colorblind (Beta)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/editor/theme/GitHub.github-vscode-theme/GitHub%20Light%20Colorblind%20(Beta)))_

## Source Control


## Terminal

### Terminal Completions (Preview) Improvements

We've significantly improved shell completions across Bash, Zsh, Fish, and PowerShell by adding completion specs (`git` for example), refining command-line parsing for better suggestions, and enhancing file and folder completions. Enable this feature with `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.enabled:true)`.

### Improved Parsing

We now leverage Fig’s parsing to support subcommands and arguments across a wider range of commands.

### Configurable Completion Behavior

Gain precise control over when completions appear using `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.quickSuggestions)`.

### Inline Suggestion Detection

With enhanced ghost text detection, inline suggestions now appear as the top completion result and can be accepted with `Tab`. Configure this behavior with `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.inlineSuggestion)`.

### Enhanced Documentation Support

Built-in commands for Zsh and Bash now include descriptions and documentation, providing details on available arguments. This information is sourced directly from each shell’s help documentation.

### Improved Sorting

Commands with completion specs and built-in commands now appear before those fetched from `$PATH` as executables.

### Alias Support

Command aliases are now displayed with a distinct icon, with the corresponding command shown as a description.

### New Icons

Enhanced parsing introduces specific icons for different completion types, improving clarity and usability.

### `$CDPATH` support

`$CDPATH` is a shell feature that enables seamless navigation to directories by treating specified paths as implicit search locations. With `$CDPATH` set, users can `cd` into a directory without needing to specify its full path.

For example, setting `CDPATH=/dev` allows running `cd vscode` to navigate directly to `/dev/vscode`, regardless of the current working directory.

This functionality is now integrated into the suggest widget, enhancing usability by recognizing and completing paths based on `$CDPATH`.

## Tasks

### Task Rerun Action
We have a new rerun task action for terminals, `kb(workbench.action.tasks.rerunForActiveTerminal)`. The action appears on the terminal tab's inline toolbar and in the terminal's context menu.

## Contributions to extensions

### Python

#### Improvements to Python Shell Integration 
Changes to `setting(python.terminal.shellIntegration.enabled)` will now be effective without having to reload. Simply create a new terminal after changing your setting for Python shell integration to see desired changes on your Python REPL in terminal. 

#### Correct Workspace Prompt For Windows Gitbash
Python users with Windows machine, using Gitbash to interact will now see correct working space directory in their terminal prompt. 
More specifically, these apply to those opted into the `pythonTerminalEnvVarActivation` experiment.

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues


## Preview Features

### Copilot Status Bar

We are experimenting with a new central Copilot related status bar entry that provides:
* quota information if you are a [Copilot Free](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2024/12/18/free-github-copilot) user
* editor related settings such as Code Completions
* some useful keyboard shortcuts to use other Copilot features

<video src="images/1_98/copilot-status.mp4" title="Copilot Status Bar" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

You can enable this new status entry by configuring the new `setting(chat.experimental.statusIndicator.enabled)`.

## Extension Authoring

### Refined Snippet API

You can now control the whitespace normalization when inserting snippets. This applies to the [`insertSnippet`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/c202fb0bcfc7ac863f90756bdf668e801b96901d/src/vscode-dts/vscode.d.ts#L1306)-API and to the [`SnippetTextEdit`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/c202fb0bcfc7ac863f90756bdf668e801b96901d/src/vscode-dts/vscode.d.ts#L3753)-API and control is the intentation of additional lines of snippets are adjusted or not

```js
const snippt = `This is an indented
    snippet`;

// keepWhitespace: false, undefined
function indentedFunctionWithSnippet() {
    return `This is an indented
        snippet`; // adjusted indentation
}

// keepWhitespace: true
function indentedFunctionWithSnippet() {
    return `This is an indented
    snippet`; // original indentation
}

```

## Proposed APIs

### Text Encodings

We added new proposed API to work with [text encodings](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/501ee833b16b8e83ba656c46e0888aadd9d2db04/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.textDocumentEncoding.d.ts#L1) in VS Code. Specifically, this new API allows to:
* get the current `encoding` of a `TextDocument`
* open a `TextDocument` with a specific `encoding`
* encode a `string` to a `Uint8Array` with a specific `encoding`
* decode a `Uint8Array` to a `string` using a specific `encoding`

Please try it out and let us know what you think [in this GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/241449).

## Engineering


### Dev-time tracking of leaked disposables

VS Code uses the disposable-pattern for explicit resource management, e.g. to close files, cleanup DOM-elements, or remove event-listeners. Not disposing of resources means memory is wasted and memory-usage accumulates over time. We are constantly on the hunt for such leaks and have now added another tool for this. We utilize the [`FinalizationRegistry`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/FinalizationRegistry)-API as it will informs us when an object has been garbage collected. If such an object represented a dispoable which has not been disposed of, then we have a leak. These are collected and shown to the developers of VS Code so that we can clean things up as we go.

## Notable fixes

## Thank you

Last but certainly not least, a big _**Thank You**_ to the contributors of VS Code.
