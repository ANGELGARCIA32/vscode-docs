### Copilot Edits

#### Refined Editor Integration

We have polished the integation of Copilot Edits with code and notebook-editors.

* For once, we don't scroll along anymore as changes are being made. The view port stays put making it easier to focus on what changes.
* When we have renamed "Accept" to "Keep" and "Discard" to "Undo". This reflects better what's happening because changes for Copilot Edits are live, they are applied and saved as they are made and users keep keep or undo them
* Last, when having made the decision to keep or undo for a file the next file is automatically revealed.


The recording below shows how edits are applied and saved as they are made. The live preview updates and the user decided to "Keep" the changes. Undoing and further tweaking is also possible.

### Refined Snippet API

You can now control the whitespace normalization when inserting snippets. This applies to the [`insertSnippet`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/c202fb0bcfc7ac863f90756bdf668e801b96901d/src/vscode-dts/vscode.d.ts#L1306)-API and to the [`SnippetTextEdit`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/c202fb0bcfc7ac863f90756bdf668e801b96901d/src/vscode-dts/vscode.d.ts#L3753)-API and control is the intentation of additional lines of snippets are adjusted or not

```js
const snippt = `This is an indented
    snippet`;

// keepWhitespace: false, undefined
function indentedFunctionWithSnippet() {
    return `This is an indented
        snippet`; // adjusted indentation
}

// keepWhitespace: true
function indentedFunctionWithSnippet() {
    return `This is an indented
    snippet`; // original indentation
}

```

### Dev-time tracking of leaked disposables

VS Code uses the disposable-pattern for explicit resource management, e.g. to close files, cleanup DOM-elements, or remove event-listeners. Not disposing of resources means memory is wasted and memory-usage accumulates over time. We are constantly on the hunt for such leaks and have now added another tool for this. We utilize the [`FinalizationRegistry`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/FinalizationRegistry)-API as it will informs us when an object has been garbage collected. If such an object represented a dispoable which has not been disposed of, then we have a leak. These are collected and shown to the developers of VS Code so that we can clean things up as we go.

## Notable fixes
