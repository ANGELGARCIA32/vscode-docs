## GitHub Copilot

TODO: @ntrogh to reference agent mode blog post

### Copilot Edits

#### Refined Editor Integration

We have polished the integation of Copilot Edits with code and notebook-editors.

* For once, we don't scroll along anymore as changes are being made. The view port stays put making it easier to focus on what changes.
* When we have renamed "Accept" to "Keep" and "Discard" to "Undo". This reflects better what's happening because changes for Copilot Edits are live, they are applied and saved as they are made and users keep keep or undo them
* Last, when having made the decision to keep or undo for a file the next file is automatically revealed.


The recording below shows how edits are applied and saved as they are made. The live preview updates and the user decided to "Keep" the changes. Undoing and further tweaking is also possible.

<video src="images/1_98/edits_editor.mp4" title="Changes from Copilot Edits are saved automatically and the user decided to keep them" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

#### Refreshed UI

In preparation for unifying Copilot Edits with Copilot Chat, we've given Copilot Edits a facelift. Files that are attached and not yet sent are now rendered as regular chat attachments. Only files that have been modified with AI are added to the changed files list above the chat input part. Related file suggestions are rendered below chat attachments when configuring `setting(chat.renderRelatedFiles)`.

## Accessibility

### Copilot Edits

We made Copilot Edits much more accessible. There are now audio signals for files with modifications and for changed regions (insertions, modification, and deletion). The accessible diff viewer is now available for modified files. Just as in diff editors select `kb(chatEditor.action.showAccessibleDiffView)` to enable it.

### `activeEditorState` window title variable

We have a new `setting(window.title)` variable, `activeEditorState`, to indicate editor information such as modified state, the number of problems, and when a file has pending Copilot Edits to screen reader users. When in Screen Reader Optimized mode, this is appended by default and can be disabled with `setting(accessibility.windowTitleOptimized:false)`.

## Workbench

### Custom title bar on Linux

The custom title bar is now enabled by default on Linux:

![Screenshot that shows the custom VS Code title bar on Linux.](images/1_97/custom-title.png)

You can always revert back to the native title decorations, either from the custom title context menu or by configuring `setting(window.titleBarStyle)` to `native`.

![Screenshot that shows the content menu option to disable the custom title bar on Linux.](images/1_97/restore-title.png)

We are happy for continued feedback on this experience and are already working on improving this for future milestones based on existing feedback.

### Secondary Sidebar Shows Labels

We decided to change the appearance of views in the secondary sidebar to show labels instead of icons, similar to the panel. This helps discover the "Copilot Edits" view. You can always go back to showing icons by configuring `setting(workbench.secondarySideBar.showLabels)`.

![Screenshot that shows secondary sidebar with labels instead of icons.](images/1_98/aux-sidebar.png)

### New Settings editor key-matching algorithm

We have added a new Settings editor search algorithm that prioritizes more relevant key matches. Try it out by clicking `setting(workbench.settings.useWeightedKeySearch:true)`.

## Editor

### Peek References Support Drag & Drop

The peek view now supports drag & drop. Invoke Peek References, Peek Implementation and any of the other peek command and drag entries from its tree to open them as separate editors.

## Source Control


## Terminal

### Terminal Completions (Preview) Improvements

We've significantly improved shell completions across Bash, Zsh, Fish, and PowerShell by adding completion specs (`git` for example), refining command-line parsing for better suggestions, and enhancing file and folder completions. Enable this feature with `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.enabled:true)`.

### Improved Parsing

We now leverage Fig’s parsing to support subcommands and arguments across a wider range of commands.

### Configurable Completion Behavior

Gain precise control over when completions appear using `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.quickSuggestions)`.

### Inline Suggestion Detection

With enhanced ghost text detection, inline suggestions now appear as the top completion result and can be accepted with `Tab`. Configure this behavior with `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.inlineSuggestion)`.

### Enhanced Documentation Support

Built-in commands for Zsh and Bash now include descriptions and documentation, providing details on available arguments. This information is sourced directly from each shell’s help documentation.

### Improved Sorting

Commands with completion specs and built-in commands now appear before those fetched from `$PATH` as executables.

### Alias Support

Command aliases are now displayed with a distinct icon, with the corresponding command shown as a description.

### New Icons

Enhanced parsing introduces specific icons for different completion types, improving clarity and usability.

### `$CDPATH` support

`$CDPATH` is a shell feature that enables seamless navigation to directories by treating specified paths as implicit search locations. With `$CDPATH` set, users can `cd` into a directory without needing to specify its full path.

For example, setting `CDPATH=/dev` allows running `cd vscode` to navigate directly to `/dev/vscode`, regardless of the current working directory.

This functionality is now integrated into the suggest widget, enhancing usability by recognizing and completing paths based on `$CDPATH`.

## Tasks

### Task Rerun Action
We have a new rerun task action for terminals, `kb(workbench.action.tasks.rerunForActiveTerminal)`. The action appears on the terminal tab's inline toolbar and in the terminal's context menu.

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

- TODO @ntrogh: add remote highlights here

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_98.md).


## Contributions to extensions

### Python

#### Improvements to Python Shell Integration
After modifying `setting(python.terminal.shellIntegration.enabled)`, you will no longer have to reload in order for changes to take effect. Simply create a new terminal to see desired changes on your Python REPL in terminal.

#### Correct Workspace Prompt For Windows Gitbash
Python users on Windows using Gitbash will now see correct working directory in their terminal prompt.
These changes apply to those opted into the `pythonTerminalEnvVarActivation` experiment.

## New setting for auto test discovery file pattern

You can now refine which files auto test discovery occurs by specifying a glob pattern in the `setting(python.testing.autoTestDiscoverOnSavePattern)` setting. Its default value is set to `**/*.py`.

## Read test debug config from settings.json as fallback

We now look for test debug configurations in both `settings.json` and `launch.json` files, expanding where you can define these configurations.

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

### GitHub Authentication

#### Improved Proxy Support with Electron `fetch` Adoption

The GitHub Authentication extension now leverages Electron's version of `fetch` in order to make web requests. This has helped users with certain proxy & firewall settings. If you know you run in an environment that has a proxy setup and you are unable to authenticate to GitHub inside of VS Code, please don't hesitate to create an issue!

## Preview Features

### Agent mode improvements (Experimental)

Last month, we introduced _agent mode_ for Copilot Edits in [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/). When in agent mode, Copilot can automatically search your workspace for relevant context, edit files, check them for errors, and run terminal commands (with your permission) to complete a task end-to-end.

We made some improvements to the UX of tool usages this month. Terminal commands are now shown inline so that you can keep track of which commands were run, and you can edit the command before accepting it if you'd like to tweak the LLM's suggestion:

TODO video

You can also expand the message to see the results of searches that were done.

![expandable agent tool results](images/1_98/image.png)

We've also made many improvements to the prompt and behavior of agent mode, so it should seem at least a little smarter.

Agent mode is still currently only available in [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/), but we are working on stabilizing it to a point where it can be enabled for VS Code Stable users. If the setting doesn't show up for you in Stable, then it isn't enabled for you yet.

![Screenshot of the agent mode setting in the Settings editor.](images/1_97/agent-setting.png)

Learn more about [agent mode in Copilot Edits](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-edits#_use-agent-mode-preview) in the VS Code documentation.

### Copilot Status Bar

We are experimenting with a new central Copilot related status bar entry that provides:
* quota information if you are a [Copilot Free](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2024/12/18/free-github-copilot) user
* editor related settings such as Code Completions
* some useful keyboard shortcuts to use other Copilot features

<video src="images/1_98/copilot-status.mp4" title="Copilot Status Bar" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

You can enable this new status entry by configuring the new `setting(chat.experimental.statusIndicator.enabled)`.

### `#codebase` with tool calling in chat queries

When you add `#codebase` to your Copilot Chat query, `#codebase` can now run tools like text search and file search to pull in additional context from your workspace. Set `setting(github.copilot.chat.codesearch.enabled)` to enable this behavior. The full list of tools is:
* Embeddings-based semantic search
* Text search
* File search
* Git modified files
* Project structure
* Read file
* Read directory
* Workspace symbol search

## Extension Authoring

### Bring authentication interactive settings of `forceNewSession` to `createIfNone` and rename `AuthenticationForceNewSessionOptions` to `AuthenticationGetSessionPresentationOptions`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We are renaming `AuthenticationForceNewSessionOptions` to `AuthenticationGetSessionPresentationOptions` and leaving a deprecated `AuthenticationForceNewSessionOptions` for now. There is no functional difference so this is not a breaking change in the runtime, but you should update your code to use `AuthenticationGetSessionPresentationOptions` instead of `AuthenticationForceNewSessionOptions` since it will be removed in the future.

Looking at these two authentication calls:
```ts
vscode.authentication.getSession(provider, scopes, { createIfNone: options });
vscode.authentication.getSession(provider, scopes, { forceNewSession: options });
```

`createIfNone` and `forceNewSession` will now take in either a `boolean` or a `AuthenticationGetSessionPresentationOptions`:
```ts
/**
 * Optional options to be used when calling {@link authentication.getSession} with interactive options `forceNewSession` & `createIfNone`.
 */
export interface AuthenticationGetSessionPresentationOptions {
	/**
	 * An optional message that will be displayed to the user when we ask to re-authenticate. Providing additional context
	 * as to why you are asking a user to re-authenticate can help increase the odds that they will accept.
	 */
	detail?: string;
}
```
_[full typings can be found here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/release/1.98/src/vscode-dts/vscode.d.ts#L17520-L17551)_...

This is a new addition for `createInNone`, but it's a modification for `forceNewSession` which use to take in a `AuthenticationForceNewSessionOptions` which had the same signature of this new `AuthenticationGetSessionPresentationOptions`.

If you are explicitly using `AuthenticationForceNewSessionOptions`, you will see it is marked as deprecated and you should replace it with `AuthenticationGetSessionPresentationOptions` as `AuthenticationForceNewSessionOptions` will be removed in a future version.

It's important to note that the only thing that is changing here are the types. **There is no runtime change so this is not a breaking change from that perspective.**

Additionally, the `authLearnMore` [proposed API](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/release/1.98/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.authLearnMore.d.ts), has been updated from `AuthenticationForceNewSessionOptions` to `AuthenticationGetSessionPresentationOptions`.

Here's an example that leverages `detail` and the `learnMore` proposal:
![auth presentation modal featuring a detail that says 'To get more relevant Copilot Chat results, we need permission to read the contents of your repository on GitHub.' and a learnMore button](images/1_98/auth-presentation.png)

### Refined Snippet API

You can now control the whitespace normalization when inserting snippets. This applies to the [`insertSnippet`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/c202fb0bcfc7ac863f90756bdf668e801b96901d/src/vscode-dts/vscode.d.ts#L1306)-API and to the [`SnippetTextEdit`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/c202fb0bcfc7ac863f90756bdf668e801b96901d/src/vscode-dts/vscode.d.ts#L3753)-API and control is the intentation of additional lines of snippets are adjusted or not

```js
const snippt = `This is an indented
    snippet`;

// keepWhitespace: false, undefined
function indentedFunctionWithSnippet() {
    return `This is an indented
        snippet`; // adjusted indentation
}

// keepWhitespace: true
function indentedFunctionWithSnippet() {
    return `This is an indented
    snippet`; // original indentation
}

```

## Proposed APIs

### Text Encodings

We added new proposed API to work with [text encodings](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/501ee833b16b8e83ba656c46e0888aadd9d2db04/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.textDocumentEncoding.d.ts#L1) in VS Code. Specifically, this new API allows to:
* get the current `encoding` of a `TextDocument`
* open a `TextDocument` with a specific `encoding`
* encode a `string` to a `Uint8Array` with a specific `encoding`
* decode a `Uint8Array` to a `string` using a specific `encoding`

Please try it out and let us know what you think [in this GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/241449).

### Shell Environment

Extensions will be able to access user's currently active shell environment information for pwsh, zsh, bash, and fish shell that are opened from the VS Code's integrated terminal. This is only enabled when `setting(terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.enabled)` is enabled.

User can decide whether or not to report their shell environment information with `setting(terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.environmentReporting)`

Give this a try and let us know what you think [in this GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/227467).

## Engineering


### Dev-time tracking of leaked disposables

VS Code uses the disposable-pattern for explicit resource management, e.g. to close files, cleanup DOM-elements, or remove event-listeners. Not disposing of resources means memory is wasted and memory-usage accumulates over time. We are constantly on the hunt for such leaks and have now added another tool for this. We utilize the [`FinalizationRegistry`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/FinalizationRegistry)-API as it will informs us when an object has been garbage collected. If such an object represented a dispoable which has not been disposed of, then we have a leak. These are collected and shown to the developers of VS Code so that we can clean things up as we go.

## Notable fixes

## Thank you

Last but certainly not least, a big _**Thank You**_ to the contributors of VS Code.
