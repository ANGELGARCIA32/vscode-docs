## Accessibility

### Chat Agent Mode Improvements

Users are now notified when manual action is required during a tool invocation—such as "Run command in terminal." This information is also included in the ARIA label for the relevant chat response, enhancing accessibility for screen reader users.

Additionally, a new accessibility help dialog is available in Agent Mode, explaining what users can expect from the feature and how to navigate it effectively.

### Accessibility Signals for Chat Edit Actions

Auditory signals are now provided when a user keeps or undoes Copilot-generated edits. These signals are configurable via `setting(accessibility.signals.editsKept)` and `setting(accessibility.signals.editsUndone)`.

### Improved Suggest Widget Item ARIA Labels

ARIA labels for suggest widget items now include richer, descriptive information—such as the type of suggestion (e.g., method, variable). This information was previously only available to sighted users via icons.

## Workbench

### Settings editor search updates

The Settings editor search has been updated to use last release's key-matching algorithm by default. It also shows additional settings even when the settings ID matches exactly with a known setting, now.

### Semantic search improvements

## Code Editing

### Tree-Sitter based syntax highlighting (Preview)

Building upon the previous work for using Tree-Sitter for syntax highlighting, we now support experimental, Tree-Sitter based, syntax highlighting for CSS files and for regular expressions within TypeScript. Use `setting(editor.experimental.preferTreeSitter.css:true)` and `setting(editor.experimental.preferTreeSitter.regex:true)` to try it out.


## Chat

### Usages Tool

In chat, there is now the `#usages` tool. It is a combination of "Find All References", "Find Implementation", and "Go to Definition" and will help chat to learn more about a function, class or interface etc. For instance, it can use this tool to look for sample implementations of an interface or to find all places that need to be changed when making a refactoring. In agent mode this tool will be picked up automatically but you can also reference it explicitly via `#usages`

### Edits Improvements

We have done some smaller tweaks when using edits.

1. We would always disable squiggles while Coplit rewrites a file. We have now extended that and mute diagnostics event outside the editor - this reduces flicker in the problems view and also ensures we don't issue requests for the quick fix code actions.

2. We now explicitly save a file when deciding to keep the edits Copilot made to it.

### Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) - Preview

![A screenshot of a "Manage Models - Preview" dropdown menu in a user interface. The dropdown has the label "Select a provider" at the top, with a list of options below it. The options include "Anthropic" (highlighted in blue), "Azure," "Gemini," "OpenAI," "Ollama," and "OpenRouter." A gear icon is displayed next to the "Anthropic" option.](images/1_99/byok.png)

User's may now bring their own API keys for popular providers such as Azure, Anthropic, Gemini, Open AI, Ollama, and Open Router. This allows users to utilize new models that are not natively supported by Copilot the very first day that they're released. To try it, just click `Manage Models...` in the model picker. To learn more about this feature, head over to our [docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/language-models).

### Faster workspace searches with instant indexing

[Remote workspace indexes](../docs/copilot/reference/workspace-context.md#remote-index) let Copilot quickly and intelligently search large codebases for relevant code snippets that it uses while answering questions and generating edits. These remote indexes are especially useful for large codebases with tens or even hundreds of thousands of files.

Previously you'd have to press a button or run a command to build and start using a remote workspace index. However with our new instant indexing support, we now automatically build the remote workspace index when you first try to ask an `#codebase`/`@workspace` question. In most cases, this remote index can be built in a few seconds. Once built, any codebase searches that you or anyone else working with that repo in VS Code makes will automatically use the remote index.

Keep in mind that remote workspaces indexes are currently only available for code stored on Github. To use a remote workspace index, make sure your workspace contains a git project with a GitHub remote. You can use the [Copilot workspace status](#workspace-index-status-moved-into-copilot-status-bar-item) to see the type of index currently being used:

![The workspace index status show in the Copilot status bar menu](images/1_99/copilot-workspace-index-remote.png)

To manage load, we'll also be slowly rolling out instant indexing over the next few weeks so you may not see it right away. During this rollout, you can still run the `GitHub Copilot: Build remote index command` command if you're to start using a remote index but instant indexing hasn't reached you yet.

### Workspace index status moved into Copilot status bar item

We've moved the [workspace index](../docs/copilot/reference/workspace-context.md) status into the Copilot status bar item:

![Viewing the index status of a workspace](images/1_99/copilot-worksspace-index-local-status.png)

This groups it with other Copilot related information. It also means that you you can now see the workspace index status even when you don't have any text files open.

## Notebooks

### New Notebook Tool
<!-- @Yoyokrazy @DonJayamanne -->

### Copilot Edits Improvements for Notebooks
<!-- @amunger @DonJayamanne -->
<!-- Navigation, Undo/Redo enhancements. Kernel variables and cell selections included in context -->

### Text and Image Output Support in Chat and Copilot Edits
You can now add notebook cell outputs—such as text, errors, and images—directly to Copilot Chat as context. Use the “Add cell output to chat” action, available via the triple-dot menu or by right-clicking the output. This lets you reference the output when using ask, edit, or agent mode, making it easier for Copilot to understand and assist with your notebook content.

### Minimal Version of Jupyter Notebook Document to 4.5
<!-- @amunger -->


## Source Control

### Reference picker improvements

This milestone we have made improvements of the reference picker that is being used for various source control operations like checkout, merge, rebase, delete branch, etc. The updated reference picker contains the details of the last commit (author, commit message, commit date), as well as ahead/behind information for local branches. The additional context will help users pick the right reference for the various operations. Users can hide the additional infromation by toggling the `setting(git.showReferenceDetails:false)`.

### Repository status bar item

Workspaces that contain multiple repositories will now have a "Source Control Provider" status bar item on the left-hand side of the branch picker displaying the active repository. The new status bar item provider additional context so that users know which is the active repository as they navigate between editors and use the "Source Control" viewlet. The "Source Control Provider" status bar item can be hidden using the context menu that is accessible by right-clicking on the status bar.

### Git blame editor decoration improvements

We have heard feedback that while typing, the "Not Yet Committed" editor decoration does not provide much value and it is more of a distraction. Starting this milestone the "Not Yet Committed" editor decoration is only being shown while navigating around the codebase either using the keyboard or the mouse.

### Commit input cursor customization

This milestone, thanks to a community contribution, we have added the `setting(editor.cursorStyle)` and `setting(editor.cursorWidth)` settings to the list of settings that are being honored by the source control input box.

## Terminal

### Reliability in Agent Mode

The tool that allows agent mode to run commands in the terminal have received a number of improvements around reliability and compatibility. You should expect less cases where the tool gets stuck or where the command finishes without the output being present.

One of the bigger changes here is the introduction of the concept of "rich" quality [shell integration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration), as opposed to "basic" and "none". The shell integration scripts shipped with VS Code should generally all enable rich shell integration which provides the best experience in the run in terminal tool (and terminal usage in general). You can view the shell integration quality by hovering the terminal tab.

### Terminal IntelliSense Improvements (Preview)

#### Enhanced IntelliSense for the `code` CLI

IntelliSense now supports subcommands for the `code`, `code-insiders`, and `code-tunnel` CLI. For instance, typing `code tunnel` shows available subcommands like `help`, `kill`, and `prune`, each with descriptive info.

![Terminal window showing code tunnel has been typed. The suggest widget shows subcommands like help, kill, prune, and others, with descriptions for each command.](images/1_99/terminal-intellisense-code-tunnel.png)

We've also added option suggestions for:

- `--uninstall-extension`
- `--disable-extension`
- `--install-extension`

These show a list of installed extensions to help complete the command.

![VSCode terminal with code --uninstall-extension. A list of available extensions is displayed, including vscode-eslint and editorconfig.](images/1_99/terminal-intellisense-extension.png)

Additionally, `code --locate-shell-integration-path` now provides shell-specific options such as `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`, and `pwsh`.

![VSCode terminal showing a command input: code --locate-shell-integration-path with a dropdown menu listing shell options bash, fish, pwsh, and zsh.](images/1_99/terminal-intellisense-locate-shell-integration.png)

#### Auto-Refresh for Global Commands

The terminal now automatically refreshes its list of global commands when changes are detected in the system `bin` directory. This means newly installed CLI tools (e.g., after running `npm install -g pnpm`) will show up in completions immediately—no need to reload the window.

Previously, completions for new tools wouldn’t appear until the window was manually reloaded due to caching.

#### Option Value Context

Terminal suggestions now display contextual information about expected option values, helping users more easily complete commands.

![The terminal shows a command in progress: npm install --omit. The terminal suggest widget displays <package type> to indicate that's the option that's expected.](images/1_99/terminal-intellisense-options.png)

#### Rich Completions for Fish Shell

In the last release, we added detailed command completions for bash and zsh. This iteration, we've expanded that support to fish as well. Completion details are sourced from the shell’s documentation or built-in help commands.

For example, typing `jobs` in fish displays usage info and options:

![Visual Studio Code Terminal with a fish terminal showing a user has typed jobs. The suggest widget shown provides information about the jobs command with detailed usage examples and options.](images/1_99/terminal-intellisense-fish.png)

#### File Type Icons in Suggestions

Suggestions in the terminal now include specific icons for different file types, making it easier to distinguish between scripts and binaries at a glance.

![A terminal showing suggestions for various script files, including code.sh, code-cli.sh, and code-server.js. Icons indicate the specific file type.](images/1_99/terminal-intellisense-icons.png)

#### Inline Suggestion Details

Inline suggestions—displayed as ghost text in the terminal—continue to appear at the top of the suggestions list. In this release, we've added command details to these entries to provide more context before accepting them.

![Block is shown as ghost text in the terminal. The first suggestion is block and it contains usage information.](images/1_99/terminal-intellisense-consolidated.png)


### New simplified and detailed tab hover

The terminal tab will show much less detail by default now:

![The simple hover shows the terminal name, PID, command line, shell integration quality and actions](images/1_99/terminal-hover-simple.png)

To view everything there is a "Show Details" button at the bottom of the hover:

![The detailed hover also shows extensions that contribute to the environment and detailed shell integration diagnostics](images/1_99/terminal-hover-detailed.png)

### Signed PowerShell shell integration

The shell integration PowerShell script is now signed, meaning shell integration on Windows when using the default PowerShell execution policy of `RemoteSigned` should now start working automatically. You can read more about [shell integration's benefits here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration).

## Debugging

## Languages


## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

- TODO @ntrogh: add remote highlights here

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_98.md).


## Contributions to extensions

### Python


### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

## Extension authoring

### Terminal.shellIntegration tweaks

The `Terminal.shellIntegration` API will now only light up when command detection happens, previously this should work when _only_ the current working directory was reported which caused `TerminalShellIntegration.executeCommand` to not function well.

Additionally, `TerminalShellIntegration.executeCommand` will now behave more consistently and track multiple "sub-executions" for a single command line that ended up running multiple commands. This depends on rich shell integration as mentioned in the [reliability in agent mode section](#reliability-in-agent-mode).

## Proposed APIs

### Task problem matcher status

We've added [proposed API](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/c98092f1caaad64e18be5b3f8761a09c24c7669c/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.taskProblemMatcherStatus.d.ts#L9-L40) so that extensions can monitor when a task's problem matchers start and finish processing lines. Enable it with `taskProblemMatcherStatus`.
