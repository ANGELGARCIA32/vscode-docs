    - Use second person: "You can now...".
    - Add clear and descriptive alt text to images.
    - Use present tense instead of future tense. "You can now see..." instead of "You will be able to see..."
    - Use active voice instead of passive voice. "Select the option to preview..." instead of "The option can be selected to preview..."

## Accessibility

### Chat Agent Mode Improvements

Users are now notified when manual action is required during a tool invocation—such as "Run command in terminal." This information is also included in the ARIA label for the relevant chat response, enhancing accessibility for screen reader users.

Additionally, a new accessibility help dialog is available in Agent Mode, explaining what users can expect from the feature and how to navigate it effectively.

### Accessibility Signals for Chat Edit Actions

Auditory signals are now provided when a user keeps or undoes Copilot-generated edits. These signals are configurable via `setting(accessibility.signals.editsKept)` and `setting(accessibility.signals.editsUndone)`.

### Improved Suggest Widget Item ARIA Labels

ARIA labels for suggest widget items now include richer, descriptive information—such as the type of suggestion (e.g., method, variable). This information was previously only available to sighted users via icons.

## Workbench


## Code Editing

### Tree-Sitter based syntax highlighting (Preview)

Building upon the previous work for using Tree-Sitter for syntax highlighting, we now support experimental, Tree-Sitter based, syntax highlighting for CSS files and for regular expressions within TypeScript. Use `setting(editor.experimental.preferTreeSitter.css:true)` and `setting(editor.experimental.preferTreeSitter.regex:true)` to try it out.


## Chat

### Usages Tool

In chat, there is now the `#usages` tool. It is a combination of "Find All References", "Find Implementation", and "Go to Definition" and will help chat to learn more about a function, class or interface etc. For instance, it can use this tool to look for sample implementations of an interface or to find all places that need to be changed when making a refactoring. In agent mode this tool will be picked up automatically but you can also reference it explicitly via `#usages`

### Edits Improvements

We have done some smaller tweaks when using edits.

1. We would always disable squiggles while Coplit rewrites a file. We have now extended that and mute diagnostics event outside the editor - this reduces flicker in the problems view and also ensures we don't issue requests for the quick fix code actions.

2. We now explicitly save a file when deciding to keep the edits Copilot made to it.

## Notebooks


## Source Control

### Reference picker improvements

This milestone we have made improvements of the reference picker that is being used for various source control operations like checkout, merge, rebase, delete branch, etc. The updated reference picker contains the details of the last commit (author, commit message, commit date), as well as ahead/behind information for local branches. The additional context will help users pick the right reference for the various operations. Users can hide the additional infromation by toggling the `setting(git.showReferenceDetails:false)`.

### Repository status bar item

Workspaces that contain multiple repositories will now have a "Source Control Provider" status bar item on the left-hand side of the branch picker displaying the active repository. The new status bar item provider additional context so that users know which is the active repository as they navigate between editors and use the "Source Control" viewlet. The "Source Control Provider" status bar item can be hidden using the context menu that is accessible by right-clicking on the status bar.

### Git blame editor decoration improvements

We have heard feedback that while typing, the "Not Yet Committed" editor decoration does not provide much value and it is more of a distraction. Starting this milestone the "Not Yet Committed" editor decoration is only being shown while navigating around the codebase either using the keyboard or the mouse.

### Commit input cursor customization

This milestone, thanks to a community contribution, we have added the `setting(editor.cursorStyle)` and `setting(editor.cursorWidth)` settings to the list of settings that are being honored by the source control input box.

## Terminal

### Reliability in Agent Mode

TODO@Tyriar

### Terminal IntelliSense improvements (Preview)

#### Terminal Suggest: Auto-Refresh Global Commands

The terminal now automatically refreshes its list of global commands when the contents of the system `bin` directory change. This means completions for newly installed global CLI tools (e.g., after running `npm install -g pnpm`) will become available immediately—no need to reload the window.

Previously, command suggestions wouldn't reflect newly added tools until a full window reload due to cached completions.

#### Option value information

We now display contextual information about the expected option values for terminal suggestions.

![The terminal shows a command in progress: npm install --omit. The terminal suggest widget displays <package type> to indicate that's the option that's expected.](images/1_99/terminal-intellisense-options.png)

#### Detailed fish command completions

Last iteration, we introduced detailed command completions for bash and zsh. Completions for bash and zsh built-in commands and PowerShell commands are now more detailed, providing details on the command and available options. This information is sourced from the shell's documentation or help commands.

In fish, `jobs` is typed and the suggest widget shows detailed information:

![Visual Studio Code Terminal with a fish terminal showing a user has typed jobs. The suggest widget shown provides information about the jobs command with detailed usage examples and options.](images/1_99/terminal-intellisense-fish.png)

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

- TODO @ntrogh: add remote highlights here

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_98.md).

## Proposed APIs

### Task problem matcher status

We've added [proposed API](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/c98092f1caaad64e18be5b3f8761a09c24c7669c/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.taskProblemMatcherStatus.d.ts#L9-L40) so that extensions can monitor when a task's problem matchers start and finish processing lines. Enable it with `taskProblemMatcherStatus`.
